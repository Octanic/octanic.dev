## My personal website!

**This is a personal challenge that makes me go back a little to the basics. Here's the deal:**

- It's a personal website about me and my work
- No libraries - _it means if I need to do something a library would do, I have to do it myself._
- Only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
- Must be responsive (at least it must be ok to see it on a smartphone or so)

**It's online!** Thanks to Netlify for making this a breeze to configure everything and look it look like magic. [Click Here to go to octanic.dev](https://octanic.dev)

## Why?
~~because I was bored and really needed to create a website for me!~~ That's a way to try to perform some skill check on the basics.

## What's Inside?
- I have a very minimalistic home page, 
- My resume on another page (with a printable version)
- A Showcase for some of my projects, either personal or freelance, or things I consider it was too nice to just let it here.
- Contact form - people can now reach me out using my website. This is better than using LinkedIN or GitHub IMO.

## What's next?
- Perhaps make it more server sided, since doing localization by hand seems to be _busy work_. 
- Also, the way it is now, forget about being friendly to crawlers/spiders. Yes, I am aware.

But hey, if I try to make it perfect at first, it would never be out, right!?
