## My personal website!

**This is a personal challenge that makes me go back a little to the basics. Here's the deal:**

- It's a personal website about me and my work
- No libraries - _it means if I need to do something a library would do, I have to do it myself._
- Only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
- Must be responsive (at least it must be ok to see it on a smartphone or so)

## Why?
~~because I was bored and really needed to create a website for me!~~ That's a way to try to check my basic skills out in order to advance with more advanced studies.

## What's Inside?
- I have a very minimalistic home page, 
- My resume on another page (with a printable version)
- **\*\*NEW\*\*** - A Showcase for some of my projects, either personal or freelance, or things I consider it was too nice to just let it here.

## What's next?
Perhaps send it into a serverside thing, since doing localization by hand seems to be _busy work_. Or perhaps explore more for my showcase possibilities. Also it can be somewhere I can place some personal API or stuff like that.
