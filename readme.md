## My personal website!

**This is a personal challenge that makes me go back a little to the basics. Here's the deal:**

- It's a personal website about me and my work
- No libraries - _it means if I need to do something a library would do, I have to do it myself._
- Only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
- Must be responsive (at least it must be ok to see it on a smartphone or so)

## Why?
~~because I was bored and really needed to create a website for me!~~ That's a way to try to check my basic skills out in order to advance with more advanced studies.

## What's Inside?
At first glance, I have a very minimalistic home page, and then, my resume on another page.

## What's next?
It will be my website, after that, I think about making APIs and some other projects.
